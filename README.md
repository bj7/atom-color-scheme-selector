An attempt at recreating the command palette style color scheme switcher found in Sublime Text
=======
# atom-color-scheme-selector package

This is my attempt to recreate the command palette color-switching package found in Sublime. It is not ready for mainstream use. It uses private functions found in Atom.core (not a good implementation) because I have not found any APIs for updating the color schemes.
